# Flappy Timeline â€” Synthesia Feature History

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project is a playful re-imagining of **Flappy Bird**, rebuilt in Python with **Pygame**, where instead of dodging plain green pipes, you fly through a **timeline of Synthesiaâ€™s key feature releases**.

Each pipe pair represents a **date** (top) and a **milestone** (bottom).  
By playing the game, you progress through the **history of Synthesiaâ€™s product evolution** â€” from the companyâ€™s founding in 2017 through to the launch of Synthesia 3.0 in 2025.
